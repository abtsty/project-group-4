        I rented the Lagoon 620 with my family for a week-long vacation and it
        was the best decision ever. The yacht was spacious, comfortable, and
        luxurious, and the crew took care of everything.

        The Azimut 80 was the most luxurious yacht I've ever been on. The cabins
        were spacious and elegant, and the outdoor areas were perfect for
        relaxing and entertaining. Worth every penny!
